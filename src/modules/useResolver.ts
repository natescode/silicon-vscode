/**
 * `@use 'path.si';` resolver — Phase −1.C of bootstrap plan.
 *
 * Pre-parse step that finds `@use '<path>';` declarations in the input source,
 * reads the named files, recursively resolves their own `@use`s, and returns a
 * single concatenated source string in dependency order.
 *
 * Why pre-parse rather than a grammar rule: per CLAUDE.md, grammar changes are
 * last-resort. The cleanup plan also picks "include = textual concatenation in
 * dependency order, error on cycles" as the simplest viable rule (cleanup-plan
 * §10).
 *
 * Scoping: `#` comments are honoured so `# @use 'x.si';` is NOT followed.
 * Visibility / namespacing is deliberately deferred to post-Stage-3 — everything
 * ends up in one global namespace as if the user had concatenated by hand.
